Installation
To get started with Plugilo Image AI Model, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

bash
git clone https://github.com/plugilode/PlugiloImageModel.git
cd plugilo-image-ai  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your machine.

Usage
Hereâ€™s a quick start guide on how to use the Plugilo Image AI Model for inference:

python
from plugilo import PlugiloModel  

# Initialize the model  
model = PlugiloModel()  

# Load a pre-trained model  
model.load("path/to/your/pretrained/model.h5")  

# Predict on a new image  
predictions = model.predict("path/to/image.jpg")  

# Output the predictions  
print(predictions)  
For more detailed examples, please refer to the examples directory.

Model Architecture
The Plugilo Image AI Model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that is optimized for processing images. It consists of several layers of convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers, ensuring effective feature extraction and classification.

Training
To train the model on your own dataset, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset in the correct format.
Modify the configuration parameters in config.py.
Run the training script:
bash
python train.py --data_dir path/to/your/dataset  
The model will save checkpoints in the specified output_dir.

Evaluation
To evaluate the model's performance on a validation dataset, use the evaluation script:

bash
python evaluate.py --model_path path/to/your/model.h5 --val_data_dir path/to/your/validation_set  
This will provide metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
